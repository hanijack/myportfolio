Project Page :
server actions can be used in order to fetch projects directly inside the server component 
Without the need of using api route handler which makes it more harder 
Server actions can be used also inside client components .
I used api route handlers because I did not want to move into using server actions directly without experimenting api routes which ofcourse have more advanced use cases  and can not be passed in certain situations .


Contact Page :
I used react hook form because I am used to it and this package offers a lot of customization like error handlers and sumbission states etc..
